# Workshop 01 EDA SAT Scores dataset

Dataset from [SAT_original.csv](httpsraw.githubusercontent.comsafesit23INT214-StatisticsmaindatasetsSAT_original.csv)

Created by Panupong Nakmanee (ID 63130500092)

### My Step
1. Define a questionCancel changes
2. Loading Library and dataset
3. xxxxxxx

## Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) 
2. Are there duplicate data sets  (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset  (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT 
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT 
6. Which school is get highest SAT score 

Can add more question ....

## Step 0 Loading library and dataset

```
#library
library(dplyr)

#dataset
sat_score <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")
```

## 1.How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?

Explain here

```
sat_score %>% count()
```

Result

```
    n
1 485
```


## 2.Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)

### 2.1. If have duplicate data
```
sat_score %>% duplicated() %>% table()
```
Result
```
FALSE  TRUE 
  478     7 
```
### 2.2. List the data that duplicate
```
sat_score %>% filter(duplicated(sat_score))
```
Result
```

```
3.How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
### 3.1. Drop duplicate data
```
sat_score <- sat_score %>% distinct()
```
Result
```
FALSE 
  478 
```
### 3.2. How many distinct school in this dataset after drop duplicate data.
```
sat_score$school_name %>% duplicated() %>% sum()
```
Result
```
0
```
4.What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
Change data to numeric before find min, max, average, quartile
```
sat_score$math_score <- as.numeric(sat_score$math_score)
sat_score$reading_score <- as.numeric(sat_score$reading_score)
sat_score$writing_score <- as.numeric(sat_score$writing_score)
```
### 4.1 min, max, average, quartile of math_score
```
summary(sat_score$math_score)
```
Result
```
  Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
   34.0   371.0   395.0   429.8   437.0  7735.0      57 
```
### 4.2 min, max, average, quartile of reading_score
```
summary(sat_score$reading_score)
```
Result
```
  Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
   37.0   367.0   391.0   399.3   416.0   679.0      57 
```
### 4.3 min, max, average, quartile of writing_score
```
summary(sat_score$writing_score)
```
Result
```
Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
   35.0   360.0   381.0   401.1   411.0  4030.0      57 
```
